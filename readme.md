## Pixel Rain

To run, execute `load #pixel_rain-1`
If you want to save it as your wallpaper (screensaver works too!), execute `save /appdata/system/wallpapers/pixel_rain.p64.png`

Takes ~9 hours to fill up the screen. I think.

## Circle Wallpaper

Makes circles of random shapes and sizes. My "Hello, World" for graphics.
